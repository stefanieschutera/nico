- a devcontainer for an consistent environment
- linting and formatting via eslint
- mocha test which are executed on save

## Repo Structure

````
src/ 
  - foo.ts
  - <code>

test/
  - foo.test.ts
  - <tests>

dist/
  - foo.js
  - <compiled js>
````

## Enable autorun

- Open the vs code tab `test`
- Click on `...`
- Select `Enable autorun`

## Conventions

### Names

Be explicit!
Do not use add words like `manager` to a class name if not realy needed. 
Bad example: [1]
![The world seen by an "Object-Oriented" programmer](https://i.redd.it/rj8raf1riyny.png) 

Try to use `get` and `set` as less as possible, because they do not add meaning. [1]

Generell

### Structure

Do not bypass the encapsularion layer, becuase otherwise the meaning of an object is lost. [1]

Use `undefined` instead of `null` whenever possible. [2]
